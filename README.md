# binom_cov_prob
R code that calculates the coverage probabilities for Wald and Agresti-Coull confidence intervals on binomial trial simulation 

Based on Wikipedia, The coverage probability, or coverage for short, is the probability that a confidence interval or confidence region will include the true value (parameter).
The construction of the confidence interval ensures that the probability of finding the true parameter $\Theta$ in the sample-dependent interval $(T_u,T_v)$ is (at least) $\Gamma$:
$$\mathbf{P}(T_u\leq \Theta \leq T_v)\geq \Gamma, ^\forall \Theta $$
